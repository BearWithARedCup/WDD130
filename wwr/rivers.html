          Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the
          Salmon river.
          <p>
            The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return
            by the people living near it because of the number of folks that
            came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the
            river that they never left.
          </p>
          <p>
            Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and
            bear and bighorn sheep are also commonly sighted. The river corridor
            is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which tower over the
            sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter from sun or rain
            when needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon
            is one of the longest undammed rivers in the United States. As a
            free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in the
            early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There
            are good rapids all summer...but f amilies with children who like to
            swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.
